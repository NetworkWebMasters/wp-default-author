WordPress - Default Author 

###Description

This plugin allows you to define the default author, both globally and per user.

The global settings are under `options-writing.php`:

The settings for each user is under `profile.php`:

<img src="https://raw.github.com/birgire/wp-default-author/master/screenshot-1.png" />

Note that the user settings will overwrite global settings.

The user can always change the author of each post later on:
